# Natureal
### ˈneɪʧəriːul

A content mod pack based on the concept of nature.

Designed to be played with friends via a dedicated server.

Still *very* early in development. Do not use unless I gave you the link to this project!

Does this work with OptiFine?
</summary>

No. Nor is this fully* compatible with OptiFine resource packs. Natureal modpack uses Sodium, Iris, etc.

\* Natureal includes a few mods that add resource pack features from OptiFine, but Natureal itself doesn't aim to be fully OptiFine-compatible.

What in the world does the summary mean?
</summary>

It's a quote from Thom Yorke's *[Analyze](https://youtu.be/MnMUdko6ljs?t=105)*, a song on an album regarding human issues. I felt it was fitting for a mod pack focused on nature!

<summary>
If this is a nature mod pack, why are there technology mods?
</summary>

Unfortunately, many of the nature-based replacements for tech mods aren't up to my standards. For example, chest-based storage systems don't have what makes AE2 great in my opinion; crafting patterns. As such, I decided to include a couple of technology mods to fill that gap. The pack's primary focus is still nature, though.

As for the Dr. Who related mods, they were added by request of the mod pack's testers. Why not?
