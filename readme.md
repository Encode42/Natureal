I did not make any of the projects that make this modpack possible.  
Make sure to give some love to the authors of the projects listed in [/mods](https://github.com/Encode42/Natureal/tree/main/mods), [/resourcepacks](https://github.com/Encode42/Natureal/tree/main/config/paxi/resourcepacks), and [/shaderpacks](https://github.com/Encode42/Natureal/tree/main/shaderpacks)!

### ‚ùî FAQ
<details>
<summary>
What makes this different from other mod packs?
</summary>

Natureal's goal is to provide the modded experience, without going too far. This means *everything* is immersive and comprehensible in-game. Through consistency and intuition, this mod pack should be enjoyable for all parties!

For example, there's no minimap mod. *Or so you may think!* You must **craft** the minimap instead! The same goes for the topic of zoom mods; use a spyglass for that!

This was inspired by [Crucial 2](https://github.com/VazkiiMods/crucial2)'s ideology ‚Äî to keep things vanilla. It's essentially the opposite of mod packs like [All The Mods](https://github.com/AllTheMods), which condense a ton of vastly different mods into their pack.

<summary>
Does this work with OptiFine?
</summary>

No. Nor is this fully* compatible with OptiFine resource packs. Natureal modpack uses Sodium, Iris, etc.

\* Natureal includes a few mods that add resource pack features from OptiFine, but Natureal itself doesn't aim to be fully OptiFine-compatible.

<summary>
If this is a nature mod pack, why are there technology mods?
</summary>

Unfortunately, many of the nature-based replacements for tech mods aren't up to my standards. For example, chest-based storage systems don't have what makes AE2 great in my opinion; crafting patterns. As such, I decided to include a couple of technology mods to fill that gap. The pack's primary focus is still nature, though.

It's your choice whether to use these mods! Alternaitves such as Create are provided and supported for those that prefer a more kinetic world.

As for the Dr. Who related mods, they were added by request of the Natureals's testers. Why not?

<summary>
How is this mod pack built?
</summary>

If you look at the mod pack's [source code](https://github.com/Encode42/Natureal), you'll notice that it isn't structured like a normal packwiz project!

I've written a wrapper around packwiz to handle additional functionality, such as zip export. You'll need Node.js and PNPM if you'd like to build this yourself using said wrapper, but otherwise, the standard packwiz files are in [`/pack/mods`](https://github.com/Encode42/Natureal/blob/HEAD/src/pack).

What in the world does the summary mean?
</summary>

It's a quote from Thom Yorke's *[Analyze](https://youtu.be/MnMUdko6ljs?t=105)*, a song on an album regarding human issues. I felt it was fitting for a mod pack focused on nature!

If you're running a dedicated server using this pack, you may notice multiple quotes mentioning nature in the MOTD. I'm not sure who said these. I just took them from a list I found online.
